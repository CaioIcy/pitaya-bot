Example projects can be found [here](https://github.com/topfreegames/pitaya-bot/tree/master/testing)

**P.S.** If you are using Minikube and have a testing pitaya server running locally(host OS), change the config.yaml to an address that the pods from minikube can access. Normally it is: **192.168.99.1**, but you can find it running **ifconfig** from host OS and looking at the inet from **vboxnet**
